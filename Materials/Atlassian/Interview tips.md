## JS coding

```
log should be there
1 problem will be there
noting down issue - it will be verbally told
func and non-func requirements
keep asking questions
any framework is allowed for use
keep asking questions - ambigous
alternative
assumptions wrong then alternative
1 hour - 1 issue
try to provide 2-3 solutions
with pros- cons of each
finalise one with proper justification over other solutions
```

interviewer is giving hints so listen carefully


1. code quality

    naming of variable, readablity
    testable, automated
    performance
    scaling
    reliability
    interest in showing it more readable & maintainable

2. adabptability

    can ask to solve it in different way 
    justify the way you pick up
    clarify any thing - don't assume
    modify if needed and asked
    be flexible to change the requirement

3. thinking 

    list possible components to solve the issue
    use more conceptual term rather then discussing simply
    clear fundamentals & use while explaining
    demonstrating Computer science concepts like complexity, abstration, logging exception 
    describe high level of solution prior to implement
    Talk about schemantic markup, event loop etc..

    Ask and focus on accessibility - A11y

4. decison making

    proper technical reason before going to next solution
    space & time complexity
    other  benefits before moving
    discuss pros & cons

5. resourcefulness

    Put debuggers
    Do logging
    can use stackoverflow
    need to refer documentation efficiently if needed
    we can ask question to interviewer and consider him as resource if required to save time.


## Interview tips

Prepare Data Structures and Algorithms questions. Practise a lot.

Browser Coding Interview where they test your frontend development skills

Javascript Coding Interview where they test algorithmic skills

Through questions like this, interviewers are mostly trying to test your skillset (and its relevance to the role) as robustly as possible, so be prepared for multiple offshoots and followups.

a lot of emphasis around not just giving a solution but presenting alternatives with pros and cons. Speak your mind.
