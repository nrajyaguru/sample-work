Controlling the frequency of function invocation, such as limiting how often a drag event handler fires, is crucial for optimizing performance and improving user experience. This can be achieved using techniques like throttling and debouncing.

### Throttling

**Throttling** ensures that a function is called at most once every specified interval. This is useful for events that fire frequently, like `scroll` or `resize`, and helps in reducing the load on the browser.

Here's how you can implement throttling in JavaScript:

#### Throttling Function Implementation

```javascript
/**
 * Throttle function to limit the rate at which a function can be called.
 * @param {Function} func - The function to throttle.
 * @param {number} limit - The time in milliseconds to limit the function calls.
 * @returns {Function} - A throttled version of the input function.
 */
function throttle(func, limit) {
  let lastFunc;
  let lastRan;

  return function() {
    const context = this;
    const args = arguments;

    if (!lastRan) {
      func.apply(context, args);
      lastRan = Date.now();
    } else {
      clearTimeout(lastFunc);
      lastFunc = setTimeout(function() {
        if ((Date.now() - lastRan) >= limit) {
          func.apply(context, args);
          lastRan = Date.now();
        }
      }, limit - (Date.now() - lastRan));
    }
  };
}
```

#### Example Usage with Drag Event

```javascript
// Example function to be throttled
function handleDragEvent(event) {
  console.log('Drag event:', event);
}

// Apply throttling to the drag event handler
const throttledDragEventHandler = throttle(handleDragEvent, 100); // 100ms limit

// Attach throttled event handler to the drag event
document.addEventListener('drag', throttledDragEventHandler);
```

### Debouncing

**Debouncing** delays the execution of a function until after a certain period of inactivity. This is useful for scenarios where you want to wait until a user has stopped interacting before performing an action, like validating an input or resizing a window.

Here's how you can implement debouncing in JavaScript:

#### Debouncing Function Implementation

```javascript
/**
 * Debounce function to delay the execution of a function until after a certain time.
 * @param {Function} func - The function to debounce.
 * @param {number} delay - The time in milliseconds to delay the function execution.
 * @returns {Function} - A debounced version of the input function.
 */
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timer;

  return function() {
    const context = this;
    const args = arguments;

    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      func.apply(context, args);
    }, delay);
  };
}
```

#### Example Usage with Drag Event

If you want to debounce a drag event (to execute an action after dragging has stopped):

```javascript
// Example function to be debounced
function handleDragEnd(event) {
  console.log('Drag ended:', event);
}

// Apply debouncing to the drag end event handler
const debouncedDragEndHandler = debounce(handleDragEnd, 200); // 200ms delay

// Attach debounced event handler to the dragend event
document.addEventListener('dragend', debouncedDragEndHandler);
```

### Summary

- **Throttling**: Limits how often a function is invoked to a maximum rate. Use it when you need to ensure a function is called at most once every specified interval, such as during continuous events like scrolling or resizing.
- **Debouncing**: Delays the function execution until after a specified period of inactivity. Use it when you want to wait until a user stops interacting, such as when typing in an input field or resizing a window.

Both throttling and debouncing are useful techniques for optimizing event handling and improving performance, depending on your specific use case.
