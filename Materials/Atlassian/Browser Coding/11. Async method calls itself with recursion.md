Sure, here's the same solution implemented using recursion without using a `while` loop:

### Recursive Async Method Implementation

```javascript
const asyncMethod = async () => {
  // Simulate an async task that randomly succeeds or fails
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const success = Math.random() > 0.5; // 50% chance of success
      success ? resolve("Success") : reject("Fail");
    }, 1000); // Simulate async operation with 1 second delay
  });
};

const callAsyncMethodNTimes = async (n, attempt = 1) => {
  try {
    const result = await asyncMethod();
    return result; // Return success if asyncMethod resolves
  } catch (error) {
    if (attempt < n) {
      console.log(`Attempt ${attempt} failed.`);
      return callAsyncMethodNTimes(n, attempt + 1); // Recurse with incremented attempt
    } else {
      return "Failed after maximum attempts";
    }
  }
};

// Usage
(async () => {
  const n = 5; // Number of attempts
  const result = await callAsyncMethodNTimes(n);
  console.log(result); // Outputs the result after n attempts or success
})();
```

### Explanation

1. **`asyncMethod`**: This remains the same, simulating an asynchronous task that randomly succeeds or fails.
2. **`callAsyncMethodNTimes`**: This function is now implemented using recursion:
    - It takes two parameters: `n` (maximum number of attempts) and `attempt` (current attempt number, defaulting to 1).
    - It tries to call `asyncMethod` and waits for it to resolve or reject.
    - If `asyncMethod` resolves (i.e., it succeeds), the result is returned immediately.
    - If `asyncMethod` rejects (i.e., it fails), the function checks if the current attempt number is less than `n`.
      - If it is, it logs the failure and calls itself recursively with the next attempt number.
      - If the current attempt number is equal to `n`, it returns a failure message.

3. **Usage Example**: The function is called with `n` set to 5. The result is logged to the console after all attempts are exhausted or on success.

This recursive implementation avoids the use of a `while` loop and relies on the natural stack management of recursion to handle retries.
