Sure! Here are detailed answers to your questions:

### 1. What's the difference between `undefined` and `null`?

**`undefined`**:
- **Definition**: `undefined` is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value. It is the default value of variables that have been declared but not initialized.
- **Usage**: Automatically assigned by JavaScript when a variable is declared but not assigned any value, or when a function does not return a value.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let a;
  console.log(a); // undefined
  ```

**`null`**:
- **Definition**: `null` is a special value explicitly assigned to a variable to indicate that it has no value. It represents intentional absence of any object value.
- **Usage**: Used when you want to explicitly indicate that a variable should have no value or object.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let b = null;
  console.log(b); // null
  ```

**Comparison**:
- `undefined` is a type itself (undefined) while `null` is an object (though it behaves like a primitive value).
- `undefined` is generally used by JavaScript, while `null` is often used by developers to indicate an intentional absence of value.

### 2. About JavaScript Prototype, `this`, and Scope

**Prototype**:
- **Definition**: In JavaScript, every object has a prototype. The prototype is an object from which the object inherits methods and properties. The prototype chain allows for method and property inheritance.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  Person.prototype.sayHello = function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  };

  const person = new Person('Alice');
  person.sayHello(); // "Hello, my name is Alice"
  ```

**`this` Keyword**:
- **Definition**: The `this` keyword refers to the context in which the function is executed. It can refer to different things depending on how the function is called:
  - In a method, `this` refers to the object that owns the method.
  - In a function, `this` refers to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode).
  - In an arrow function, `this` is lexically bound to the enclosing execution context.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const obj = {
    name: 'Alice',
    greet: function() {
      console.log(this.name); // Alice
    }
  };
  obj.greet();
  
  const greet = obj.greet;
  greet(); // undefined (or error in strict mode)
  ```

**Scope**:
- **Definition**: Scope refers to the visibility of variables within different parts of your code. JavaScript has two types of scope:
  - **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside any function or block are in the global scope.
  - **Local Scope**: Variables declared inside a function or block are in the local scope.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let globalVar = 'I am global';
  
  function testScope() {
    let localVar = 'I am local';
    console.log(globalVar); // I am global
    console.log(localVar);  // I am local
  }
  
  testScope();
  console.log(localVar); // ReferenceError: localVar is not defined
  ```

### 3. Why would you choose `let` over `var`, `const` over `let`?

**`let` vs `var`**:
- **Block Scope**: `let` is block-scoped, meaning it is confined to the block (enclosed by `{}`) in which it is declared. `var` is function-scoped, meaning it is available throughout the function in which it is declared.
- **Hoisting**: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their function and initialized with `undefined`. `let` is hoisted but not initialized, so accessing it before the declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.
- **Re-declaration**: `var` allows re-declaration of the same variable within the same scope, while `let` does not.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  function example() {
    if (true) {
      var x = 1;
      let y = 2;
    }
    console.log(x); // 1
    console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
  }
  ```

**`const` vs `let`**:
- **Immutability**: `const` creates a constant reference to a value. You cannot reassign a new value to a `const` variable. However, if the value is an object, you can still modify the object's properties.
- **Block Scope**: Both `const` and `let` are block-scoped.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const a = 10;
  a = 20; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
  
  const obj = { name: 'Alice' };
  obj.name = 'Bob'; // This is allowed
  ```

### 4. Decimal to Base-7 Conversion

To convert a decimal number to base-7, you repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give you the number in base-7.

**Algorithm**:
1. Divide the decimal number by 7.
2. Record the remainder.
3. Update the number to the quotient.
4. Repeat until the quotient is 0.
5. The base-7 representation is the remainders read from last to first.

**Example Function**:

```javascript
function decimalToBase7(decimal) {
  if (decimal === 0) return '0';
  
  let base7 = '';
  while (decimal > 0) {
    base7 = (decimal % 7) + base7;
    decimal = Math.floor(decimal / 7);
  }
  
  return base7;
}

console.log(decimalToBase7(100)); // Output: '202'
```

**Explanation**:
- For the decimal number `100`:
  - `100 รท 7 = 14` remainder `2`
  - `14 รท 7 = 2` remainder `0`
  - `2 รท 7 = 0` remainder `2`
  - Reading the remainders from last to first gives `202` in base-7.

These answers should help you understand and explain these fundamental JavaScript concepts effectively.


To convert a decimal number to base-7 using recursion, you can follow a similar approach to the iterative method but use a recursive function to handle the conversion.

### Recursive Approach

The recursive function will perform the conversion by:
1. Dividing the number by 7.
2. Recursively calling itself with the quotient.
3. Accumulating the remainders to form the base-7 representation.

### Recursive Function

Here's how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
function decimalToBase7(decimal) {
  // Base case: when the decimal is 0
  if (decimal === 0) return '0';

  // Helper function to perform the conversion recursively
  function convert(decimal) {
    if (decimal === 0) return '';
    const remainder = decimal % 7;
    const quotient = Math.floor(decimal / 7);
    return convert(quotient) + remainder;
  }

  return convert(decimal);
}

console.log(decimalToBase7(100)); // Output: '202'
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case**:
   - When `decimal` is `0`, return `'0'`. This handles the case where the initial number is `0`.

2. **Helper Function** (`convert`):
   - **Recursion**: The function calculates the remainder when the decimal number is divided by `7`, which is added to the result of the recursive call with the quotient (`Math.floor(decimal / 7)`).
   - **Termination**: The recursion terminates when `decimal` becomes `0`.

3. **Combining Results**:
   - The base-7 number is built by concatenating the remainders obtained from each recursive step.

This recursive function provides a clear and elegant way to convert a decimal number to its base-7 representation.
