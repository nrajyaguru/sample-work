### Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) Overview

**Vanilla JavaScript** refers to plain JavaScript without the use of libraries or frameworks. ES6+ denotes ECMAScript 2015 and later versions, which introduce new features and enhancements to JavaScript. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of important concepts, including page lifecycle events, and sample interview questions with answers.

### Key Features of ES6+

1. **Let and Const**: Block-scoped variables and constants.
   ```javascript
   let x = 10;
   const y = 20;
   ```

2. **Arrow Functions**: Shorter function syntax and lexical `this` binding.
   ```javascript
   const add = (a, b) => a + b;
   ```

3. **Template Literals**: Multi-line strings and string interpolation.
   ```javascript
   const name = 'World';
   const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
   ```

4. **Destructuring Assignment**: Unpack values from arrays or properties from objects.
   ```javascript
   const [a, b] = [1, 2];
   const {x, y} = {x: 10, y: 20};
   ```

5. **Spread and Rest Operators**: Spread arrays into function arguments or merge arrays; collect multiple elements into a single array.
   ```javascript
   const arr1 = [1, 2];
   const arr2 = [3, 4];
   const merged = [...arr1, ...arr2];
   
   const sum = (...numbers) => numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
   ```

6. **Promises and Async/Await**: Handle asynchronous operations more effectively.
   ```javascript
   const fetchData = async () => {
     try {
       let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
       let data = await response.json();
       console.log(data);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(error);
     }
   };
   ```

7. **Classes**: Object-oriented programming with classes and inheritance.
   ```javascript
   class Animal {
     constructor(name) {
       this.name = name;
     }
     speak() {
       console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
     }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
     speak() {
       console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
     }
   }

   const dog = new Dog('Rex');
   dog.speak(); // Rex barks.
   ```

8. **Modules**: Import and export functionality between files.
   ```javascript
   // math.js
   export const add = (a, b) => a + b;

   // app.js
   import { add } from './math.js';
   console.log(add(2, 3));
   ```

### Page Lifecycle Events

Understanding the page lifecycle is crucial for managing when to execute code during different stages of a webpage's lifecycle. Key events include:

1. **`DOMContentLoaded`**: Fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.
   ```javascript
   document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
     console.log('DOM fully loaded and parsed');
   });
   ```

2. **`load`**: Fired when the whole page, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images, has been loaded.
   ```javascript
   window.addEventListener('load', () => {
     console.log('Page fully loaded');
   });
   ```

3. **`beforeunload`**: Fired when the window, the document, and its resources are about to be unloaded.
   ```javascript
   window.addEventListener('beforeunload', (event) => {
     event.preventDefault();
     event.returnValue = ''; // For legacy browsers
     console.log('Page is about to be unloaded');
   });
   ```

4. **`unload`**: Fired when the document or a child resource is being unloaded.
   ```javascript
   window.addEventListener('unload', () => {
     console.log('Page is unloading');
   });
   ```

### Interview Questions and Answers

**1. What is the difference between `let` and `var`?**

**Answer**: 
- `var` is function-scoped or globally-scoped and can be re-declared within the same scope. `let` is block-scoped and cannot be re-declared within the same block. `var` also has hoisting issues, meaning it is initialized to `undefined` at the beginning of its scope, while `let` does not initialize until the declaration is encountered.

**Example**:
```javascript
function testVarLet() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 1;
    let y = 2;
  }
  console.log(x); // 1
  console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
}
testVarLet();
```

**2. How do `Promises` work in JavaScript?**

**Answer**: 
A `Promise` represents a value that may be available now, or in the future, or never. It has three states: `pending`, `fulfilled`, and `rejected`. Promises are used for handling asynchronous operations and provide methods such as `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` for handling results and errors.

**Example**:
```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve('Success!'), 1000);
});

myPromise
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

**3. What is the purpose of `async` and `await`?**

**Answer**: 
`async` and `await` simplify working with Promises by allowing you to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. The `async` keyword makes a function return a Promise, and `await` pauses the function execution until the Promise is resolved.

**Example**:
```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

**4. How do you handle asynchronous code in JavaScript?**

**Answer**: 
Asynchronous code can be handled using Callbacks, Promises, or `async`/`await`. Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, Promises represent future values, and `async`/`await` provides a cleaner syntax for working with Promises.

**Example with Callback**:
```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => callback('Data fetched'), 1000);
}

fetchData(data => console.log(data));
```

**Example with Promises**:
```javascript
const fetchData = () => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve('Data fetched'), 1000));

fetchData().then(data => console.log(data));
```

**Example with `async`/`await`**:
```javascript
const fetchData = async () => {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve('Data fetched'), 1000));
};

const getData = async () => {
  const data = await fetchData();
  console.log(data);
};

getData();
```

**5. Explain the page lifecycle events and how you use them in JavaScript.**

**Answer**:
- `DOMContentLoaded` fires when the initial HTML document is fully loaded and parsed.
- `load` fires when the entire page and all its resources have finished loading.
- `beforeunload` fires when the user is about to leave the page, allowing for a confirmation dialog.
- `unload` fires when the page is being unloaded, but is less commonly used due to its deprecation in favor of `beforeunload`.

**Example**:
```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  console.log('DOM is fully loaded and parsed');
});

window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  console.log('Page and all resources are fully loaded');
});

window.addEventListener('beforeunload', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  event.returnValue = 'Are you sure you want to leave?';
});
```
