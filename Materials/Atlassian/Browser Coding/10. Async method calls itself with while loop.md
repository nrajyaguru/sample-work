Certainly! Below is an implementation of an asynchronous method in JavaScript that calls itself up to `n` times until it succeeds. If it does not succeed after `n` attempts, it returns a failure message.

### Async Method Implementation

```javascript
const asyncMethod = async () => {
  // Simulate an async task that randomly succeeds or fails
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const success = Math.random() > 0.5; // 50% chance of success
      success ? resolve("Success") : reject("Fail");
    }, 1000); // Simulate async operation with 1 second delay
  });
};

const callAsyncMethodNTimes = async (n) => {
  let attempts = 0;

  while (attempts < n) {
    try {
      const result = await asyncMethod();
      return result; // Return success if asyncMethod resolves
    } catch (error) {
      attempts++;
      console.log(`Attempt ${attempts} failed.`);
    }
  }

  return "Failed after maximum attempts";
};

// Usage
(async () => {
  const n = 5; // Number of attempts
  const result = await callAsyncMethodNTimes(n);
  console.log(result); // Outputs the result after n attempts or success
})();
```

### Explanation

1. **`asyncMethod`**: This is a mock asynchronous method that randomly succeeds or fails. It uses a timeout to simulate an asynchronous operation.
2. **`callAsyncMethodNTimes`**: This function takes an integer `n` as an argument, which specifies the maximum number of attempts.
    - A `while` loop runs up to `n` times.
    - In each iteration, it calls `asyncMethod` and waits for it to resolve or reject.
    - If `asyncMethod` resolves (i.e., it succeeds), the result is returned immediately.
    - If `asyncMethod` rejects (i.e., it fails), the loop continues to the next iteration.
    - If the loop completes without a successful call, it returns a failure message.

3. **Usage Example**: The function is called with `n` set to 5. The result is logged to the console after all attempts are exhausted or on success.

This implementation ensures that the asynchronous method will retry up to `n` times and provides a clear output if it ultimately fails after the maximum number of attempts.
