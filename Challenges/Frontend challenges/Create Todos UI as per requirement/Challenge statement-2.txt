Given a database of the todos added by our users and an API endpoint that returns 50 todos at a time.
Currently, the product has three premium users with userId 15, 27, and 39.
We want to build a new page that will display the following:
* The list of the first five todos of each premium user
* Todos that are completed should have a different color

You can get the todos from this endpoint https://dummyjson.com/todos?limit=50&skip=${skip}. The endpoint can return only 50 todos at a time, and you are allowed to modify only the skip parameter.

The endpoint will return this structure:
Total of 50 todos
{
  "todos": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "todo": "Do something nice for someone I care about",
      "completed": true,
      "userId": 26
    },
    ...
  ],
